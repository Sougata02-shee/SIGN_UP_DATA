#Dynamic Form Submission and Data Display

Description
This project demonstrates a simple form submission using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can input details, and upon submission, the data is dynamically displayed in a table format below the form.

Features
Input fields for User, Password, Role, Email, and Age.
A "Submit" button that dynamically generates a table displaying the entered values.
A responsive table to visually organize and present user data.

How it Works
Users fill out the form with their details.
On clicking "Submit," JavaScript captures the input values.
The captured values are rendered in an HTML table using innerHTML.
